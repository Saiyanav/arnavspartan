**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Writer/Creator)`**

A full-stack developer pursuing his bachelors in technology.

Building my own digital world one step at a time. My current coding projects are basic, however, bigger things are on the way. Becoming skilled at LeetCode is also a major milestone for me, which I'm working hard towards.

My goal is to ship software which will change people's lives.
