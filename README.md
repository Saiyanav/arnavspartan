**`Digital Craftsman`**

I bring ideas to life, grind LeetCode, and write on Twitter (https://x.com/saiynav).

I fell for the magnificence of technology during 8th grade and since have had a vision to create something for the people of the world and provide opportunities for others. My aim is simple â€“ hustle for the things I desire to achieve, including giving my parents the life of their dreams, never needing a loan for anything, and to be an example to this generation. I've had quite a few setbacks and still do, but nothing is enough to make me give up. I will become the best and I give my word for it. I hope you find some value or inspiration from my profile.

Thanks for the read.
