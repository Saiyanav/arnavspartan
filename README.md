**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Writer/Creator)`**

I'm a full-stack developer doing my bachelors in technology, building my own digital world one step at a time. My current coding projects are basic, however, bigger things are on the way. Becoming skilled at LeetCode is also a major milestone for me, which I'm working hard towards. My goal is to ship software which will change people's lives.
